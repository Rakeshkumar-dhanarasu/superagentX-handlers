                    If the task involves implementing or creating, do NOT attempt to implement or create. 
                    Instead, collect evidence that shows what has been implemented or created.

                    When retrieving data from any system or API (such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, or on-prem tools), 
                    you must also gather and summarize all related association details.

                    For example, if collecting evidence about AWS EC2 instances, include:
                    - associated security groups and their inbound/outbound rules (including open ports and protocols),
                    - IAM roles or instance profiles attached,
                    - key pairs used,
                    - attached EBS volumes,
                    - elastic IPs (if any),
                    - tags applied.

                    Ensure that your summary captures all relationships and configurations that are relevant for compliance, 
                    security, and risk review.

                    Be thorough and exhaustive in summarizing this context in your evidence data.
